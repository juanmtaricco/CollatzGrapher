Have fun plotting the Collatz sequence of a given number

From Wiki...

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1. 







Find out how long it takes for your number to reach 1 and see it happen in pretty colors.

(This is a work in progress. Soon I will add a more dynamic way to set the starting number and better graphic representation of the series)
